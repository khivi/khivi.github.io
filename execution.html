<p><em>Technical skill is mastery of complexity while creativity is mastery of simplicity — Erik Christopher</em></p>
<p>Build very a strong technical foundation. This will allow one to be creative solutions to business problems. Lean towards simple solutions; understanding that the need for complexity will be reluctantly introduced. The purpose of training yourself in your craft is to be the best in it.</p>
<h2 id="last-responsible-moment">Last Responsible Moment</h2>
<p><em>Do you we need to do this next week, next quarter or next year? — khivi</em></p>
<p>Delay decisions until the last responsible moment, that is, the moment at which failing to make a decision hurts your business.</p>
<p>Hence, most often, it is best not to make a decision. Early decisions — are a risk to a project. They are hard to change later. The key is — to make decisions as late as you can responsibly wait — because then you will always more information.</p>
<h2 id="deliver">Deliver</h2>
<p><em>Build the knowns. Research the unknowns. — khivi</em></p>
<p>Deliver what you understand.  It will not have all the features that you think you want. Make smart assumptions and get feedback from customer. We have a tendency to keep pondering on the unknowns without making progress. Hence, build at least what you understand. </p>
<h2 id="habitual-rituals">Habitual Rituals</h2>
<p><em>Once you are on a moving bicycle, it is hard to stop it. — khivi</em></p>
<p>Having consistent habits, builds muscle memory. It aligns team members work better with each other. You are consistently making progress each cycle; and over time you reach closer to your goal. There is not much fanfare in your routines, just progress. Agile methodologies strives to build processes to achieve this.</p>
<p>It is similar to: once you are on a bicycle, it will continuously move and it is harder to stop it. </p>
<h2 id="change-is-constant">Change is Constant</h2>
<p><em>There is nothing permanent except change. — Heraclitus, Greek philosopher</em></p>
<p>Develop tools and processes such that you can make changes with lower risk.  A quote by Abraham Lincoln — “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.”. This will allow you to reuse the same axe when it is a different tree.</p>
<p>Execution is than making smart tradeoffs; but always prepared for change. Successful trategy is delivers for change. </p>
<h2 id="strong-views-weekly-held-">Strong Views, weekly held.</h2>
<p><em>I reserve the right to be wrong. — khivi</em></p>
<p>Stand by your convictions. Be ready to explain reasons for them. But also be ready to change as you learn. Note any view is only correct at the time you made it — as time changes those assumptions might not be true.</p>
<p>You have opinions on what you know and your biases. They are only right in your frame of reference.</p>
<h2 id="be-roughly-right">Be Roughly Right</h2>
<p><em>Perfection is a myth. — khivi</em></p>
<p>Do not strive to be perfect. It is fool-hardy and a resource sync. Aim for being roughly right. You should make intelligent tradeoffs and short-cuts. Be ready to do things which you might have to fix later. </p>
<p>The 80:20 rule says he that 80% of output will be result of only 20% of your resources. The rest 20% will take 80% of resources. Don’t fret the 20%. Do the 80% well.</p>
<h2 id="be-consistent">Be Consistent</h2>
<p><em>Consistency over time is trust. — Satya Nadella</em> </p>
<p>Keep similar things same. The relates to process, documentation, programming, architecture etc..  When they are a bit different, it makes humans notice. We spend time thinking on the difference. Use your finite brainpower to solve real problems instead of figuring out quirks. If you change something in once area, be ready to change it everywhere. </p>
<p>When we see consistency, they see familiarity and helps us understand better.</p>
