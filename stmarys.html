<p>In 2018, we had a reunion after 30 years of leaving St. Mary’s. About 40 fellow students met in Goa. I had only been in touch with a few of them over the years. So I met most people after 30 years and was pleasantly surprised I was able to recognize nearly all of them.</p>
<p>Most of us had spent from preparatory (kindergarten) to 10th standard at St. Mary’s. On meeting, we were able to reconnect without missing a heartbeat. Some of us might not have interacted much in school, but there was a bonding that was natural. </p>
<p>The years from being kids to young boys when we left St. Mary’s had left a profound impression on all our us. As with any school, there were cliques. </p>
<h2 id="school-bus">School Bus</h2>
<p>The first clique you were part of being on the same school bus. The buses had a numbering scheme from 1 to 5. There were other private buses which were like the yellow bus, etc. Bus number 3 was a shiny Mercedes Benz. Later, during our time at school bus number 1 (which was my Bus) was also updated to the newer version.</p>
<p>The first friend I would have would be Vishal Sheth. We got onto bus number 1 on different bus stops and got off at the same bus stop. I was at the bus stop which was picked up last on the route. While waiting at the bus stop at exactly 8:30 am we would see Shashi Kapoor drive by wearing a white kurta pajama in white Mercedes driven by a chauffeur dressed in white. </p>
<p>Sorry I did not mean to ramble. Within first weeks of joining St. Mary’s, Vishal and my mother met at the pick-up bus stop. They ended up being friends, even to this day. Vishal and I ended up hanging out at each other’s place often. We got to know each other’s extended family. We used to play table tennis on his long dining table where we made the net using his aunt’s pulp fiction novels. Much later in 6th or 7th standard I also started going with  Vishal to Hindu gymkhana to play tennis on Saturday early mornings. The memory we have of that is on the way back we used to in moong dal with kanda-nimbu from the vendor near our house.</p>
<p>Back to the school bus. Jehil Thacker was the last drop off at the of the road for bus number one. The Lal brother (Manoj and Pankaj) were there too. Amit Mehta, Harpreet Singh, and Nikhil Mirchandani got in the middle near the flyover. Manek was close, and Rustom Mulla (and his brother Manek) lived in the same building as Vishal. Based on your seniority you sat on the bus. As we got older, you could sit towards the back of the bus. So in the final few years, we were the kings of the bus which meant we sat in the last row.</p>
<p>Our bus journey has its sights. We used to cross the fish market at Bombay central where the smell was unusual. We passed Alexandra cinema where the suggestive posters and the names of English movies had their Hindi translations which were always funny. We also crossed the Nagpada lockup where if you looked far enough, you could see the prisoners behind bars.</p>
<h2 id="divisions-and-houses">Divisions and Houses</h2>
<p>The next clique was the divisions. Each year we had three divisions. The first three years (prep to 1st) you were in the same division and same for the last two year (9th and 10th). The rest of the time each year the students were rotated among the three divisions based on your roll number. Our placement in a division was sequential based on your roll number the previous year.  So the roll number before and after you were in different divisions. This rotation allowed all of us to know most since you ended up in the same division. </p>
<p>The next clique was the house you were part of. We had four houses red, green, blue and white. I was the captain of the blue house in the final year. We had competitions between the houses. Debating, drama, sports were some of the areas where we competed. It was these competitions where you interacted with the boys who were senior and junior to you.</p>
<h2 id="junior-school">Junior School</h2>
<p>I was in division 1 from prep to 2nd standard where Ms. Marie Martin was our class teacher. I remember our white books where we made word lists with a pencil. In the afternoon after a lunch break, we would take our cane mats and take a nap. We used to play in the garden behind prep 1.</p>
<p>From 3rd standard to 5th standard we had EVS as a subject. Environmental Studies was my favorite subject. We had files where we did projects I social sciences based l what was around us. Until today I continue to be curious if the immediate world around us. The project I still remember where we walked around the school and identified the different trees based on the shape of the leaves. Our school has had various trees on its campus, especially the banyan tree near the back gate. We also learned about the history of our school buildings. </p>
<p>In 5th standard, the class teacher was Ms. D’Gama. That year Gold spot had a contest for advertising phrases. I remember she came third in that contest. I thought that was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Until 5th standard, you were in Junior school. For some time our vice-principal for Junior school was Everest Newnes who later was also the school principal. Our school was founded and run by the <strong>Jesuits</strong>. They were humble and passionate. Some of them were taskmasters. It continues to amaze me how some of them left Spain as young men and made India their home in their service of educating us.</p>
<h2 id="buildings">Buildings</h2>
<p>We had an auditorium which was pretty extensive. We had our debates, quizzing musical performances there. In junior school, we also had film afternoon on Wednesday. We typically saw old black-and-white documentaries. I think we even saw the cartoons and movies of Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. </p>
<p>The father’s residence was one building in school which we did not venture into except when you bruised yourself. There was an infirmary in there. I remember a brother used to put tincture on the wound which was purple.</p>
<p>The bottom corridor of the father’s residence was the pictures of alumni. I wonder if our photos are on the wall there now. Anyway, as kids it was, we would be in awe looking at the pictures on the wall. </p>
<p>Our school was located in Magazaon nestled between Nesbit Road (Sardar Balwant Singh Dhodhi Marg), the Central Railway yards and the Philips factory. In later years there was a building within the Philips factory compound. When going to Pune on the Deccan Queen, you could glance a glimpse of the school ground as you passed it. As a kid that was a secret pleasure, you had on the train.</p>
<h2 id="subjects">Subjects</h2>
<p>We did learn Marathi in junior school and Hindi until 10th standard. I remember our first Marathi lesson which was “आई घर बघ”.  Also, remember a poem called “ फुलपाखरू&quot; which meant butterfly. Our Hindi teachers Ms. Wagmar and later Mr. Rai were strict. I guess they had to be since most of us were not have been that interested in the language.</p>
<p>Music was one area where I realized I was horrible. I remember the music classes with Mr. Henderson in junior school. I did enjoy the Christmas carols. We also sang the theme music of the tv show FireBall which was fun. I did play some sports during our gym class. Remember playing basketball and handball. We learned the high jump using the Fosbury flop technique. </p>
<p>History, as taught by Ms. Mathias, is also a passion. Stevens taught us geography, and she always had stories of their travels which made her classes enjoyable. The survey maps in the ICSE were also great fun. Maps being another passion of mine that started out in school.</p>
<p>In school, we sometimes had a free period. A class where the teacher was absent. During that period Sunil Ramsey would tell the whole class stories from the scripts of the Ramsey movies. I also remember Zahir Mirza also telling us stories from American horror movies. They both were great storytellers.</p>
<h2 id="outings">Outings</h2>
<p>I was with the Cubs. The first time I went to a camp was with the cubs with the teachers and Everest Newnes. We stayed in Vithalwadi a place in a suburb of Pune. We had fun, I vaguely remember fancy dress completion, and various games we played there. </p>
<p>For most of the junior school, we also had a yearly picnic. The earliest I remember is going to Ferry Wharf in a BEST bus. We also took a boat ride at Ferry Wharf. We went to Milk Colony in Worli, the zoo at Byculla, Godrej factory, etc. One year we went to Film City courtesy of Sunil Ramsey. </p>
<p>Later in senior, I joined the Scouts we went a few times to hike to Karnala off the old Bombay Goa highway. A few times we also hiked up to Matheran. I remember one such hike where it was raining. Someone from the batch senior to us got sick, and few of us got lost. It was a scary experience.</p>
<p>Father Casale was a great storyteller. He was an authority on Indian history and architecture. He organized tours each summer through our India. I went on all the trips except the first one to Mount Abu. We went to Many parts of North India usually started out in Delhi. Kashmir, Nainital, Kulu-Manali were some of the places we visited on our tours.</p>
<p>In ninth standard, we went to Tamil Nadu. We were the eldest class, so we had the most fun. Pondicherry was the most fun. The teachers accompanying other than Fr. Casale was Mr. Simoes (maths teacher), Ms. Georgina and Ms. Mathias. There was the group of us that went to most of the tours over the years. I remember, Manek, Vishal, Joydeep, Rustam, Aftab and Altaf on most of the trips. Sometimes the architecture parts of the tour might have bored us, but sometimes they were fun.</p>
<h2 id="computer">Computer</h2>
<p>My real passion is computer programming. The PTA had bought a set of computers for our school. One was an Apple-2e, and another was BBC micro. In the 8th standard on Saturday morning, we would go to computer classes. An external teacher conducted the course. He was a young man (whose name I do not recollect) and a couple of others who helped with the classes and labs. I was hooked and ended up making a career from my passion for computer programming.</p>
<p>Sanjeev Athalye had similar passions the last few years of school. Both of us spent the last years ago talking about programming and other world affairs. We used to visit different geeky events throughout the city. We both were in Sinhals coaching together. Later on, we did our 11th and 12th at Ruparel. </p>
<h2 id="hobby-arts-and-crafts">Hobby Arts and Crafts</h2>
<p>Manek, Cyrus, Vishal and I also spend a large part of junior and middle school years together. Our mothers ran the Hobby Arts and Crafts, and to this day our mothers are friends. There are different areas which one could take from science, carpentry, elocution. It was different than the usual school subjects.</p>
<p>The HAC was a weekly 2-hour class in the 6th and 7th standard. I did science one year. We had these electronic kits which allowed us to build stuff. For the final project, I made a burglar alarm which was a house when you opened the door there was a hidden light. The house kept falling apart. Vishal had built a traffic signal which was pretty cool. In 7th standard, I ended up taking public speaking under Ms. Mehra Vakil. </p>
<h2 id="birthdays">Birthdays</h2>
<p>The birthday parties were always fun. My birthday was before school started in June so rarely had parties for myself. I remember going each year to Kushal’s place in Worli behind the police barracks. In Kushal’s party, his extended family had organized a treasure hunt for us which was a lot of fun. I also remember treasure hunts at Vanvathys’ parties on their terrace. My love for puzzles continues.</p>
<p>Jehil has his parties at Flortilla club near Chowpatty. Keshab had his party at WIAA. Fardoon had his birthday at NSCI. Others whose birthdays I remember also going to the homes were Sumeer, Rajesh, Rahul, Harshad, Kabir, etc.</p>
<p>The birthday tradition was as a guest you came with a present for the birthday boy, and when you left, you got a “return present” as a party favor. If your birthday fell on a school day, you did not wear a uniform to school. You brought sweets which you distributed to your class. Then also you could go around to different classrooms they offer candy to the teacher. A quaint tradition now that you think about it.</p>
<h2 id="lunch">Lunch</h2>
<p>The afternoon break was where we ate our lunch. Some of us got lunch from home. The famous Bombay dabbawalas delivered some of our lunch.  There was also Frankie’s canteen. They served the same food each day. It was fried rice with some form of goulash. I distinctly remember the smell and taste of the fried papad and pickle he served.</p>
<p>The last few years, the PTA forced Frankie out and got a new caterer. He was a Sikh person who served us in tradition partitioned metal plates in the senior assembly hall. The menu was exciting and varied. </p>
<p>We also could get the Energy milk drink.  You bought a coupon booklet and could use a coupon to buy the bottle. It came in a few flavors pineapple, chocolate, pistachio, etc. Even today, having the Energy drink brings back memories.</p>
<h2 id="games">Games</h2>
<p>The memories I have of the lunch break are the games we played. We had our quaint games with marbles or a spinning top. We also played hand-cricket, hand-squash, soccer, etc. Remember playing the <em>triangle</em> game with marbles on the school playground. The milky-white marbles were the most treasured.</p>
<p>During the 80s the handheld Nintendo games were popular. We played games like Parachute, Donkey Kong, etc. We were not allowed to bring them to school, but some folks did carry them. We had a quaint card game we used to play. It was a pack of cards on a topic (for example cars). Each card had statistics about a car (speed, weight, etc.). Each person got a card, and then one player chooses a statistic. The winner of that round was who had the highest statistic value. I would have no idea if this were unique to our school or a favorite game in the 80s.</p>
<h2 id="visitors">Visitors</h2>
<p>Through our years in school, we did have some visitors. I remember in 3rd or 4th standard an Australian comic group of 3 men came and performed in school. In the 8th standard, the PTA organized a musical night (I think it was to collect money for computers) where Mahendra Kapur (music director), Rohan Kapur and Farah performance. Tabu who was not famous then also came.
Zubin Mehta (who was our school alumni) did visit once with Dom Moraes. We had an anti-drug lecture by Yusuf Merchant and a sex education lecture during our final years. In our years Mother Thresa also did visit our school.</p>
<p>Some of our class who were part of interact club used to go and volunteer at Mother Thresa’s home nearby. We also visited children at the school for the deaf nearby. I also remember going to the orphanage near Alexandra cinema where we took gifts for the kids. </p>
<h2 id="uniform">Uniform</h2>
<p>Our uniform was white with the blue tie. You wore your house badge on the tie. We could wear any shoes. Ability to wear colorful shoes allowed us to bring your individual self to school compared to other schools in Bombay, which had mandatory white/black shoes each day. I appreciated our school allowed us to express our individualism with our shoes.</p>
<p>The final memory of school was going to see the movie “Top Gun” at Sterling theatre after our ICSE exams were over. This movie defined our generation.</p>
