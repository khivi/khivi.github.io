<p>Started my career at <em>Bell Labs</em> where we took a research prototype to a
commercially deployed product in all of Lucent&#39;s wireline and wirele ss
products. This was a high performance (ACID) database which had read performance
10 times fa ster than any other disk based database engine.  I worked in various
aspects from mutex, locking, index and relational subsystems. This was a one of
the most rewarding endeavors and glad to have been part of the <em>Datablitz</em> team
in my first job after school.</p>
<p><br>
After this I moved to a startup building hight performance routers. We had
creative culture which allowed us to be very productive.  I worked in the
network management team where I was responsible for the storage systems on the
routers. Also spent some time in the protocol stack and with enhancing our
integration test suites. We were bought by <em>UTstarcom</em> a telecom solution
provider.</p>
<p><br>
The next startup was still in the telecom space. We build technology to enable
mobile broadcasting applications. TV was the first application we targeted. I
was responsible for the server team and built the world&#39;s only multi-protocol tv
guide server for mobile broad casting. I lead a distributed team in NJ and
Ukraine.</p>
<p><br>
At this point I decided to look at other domains and fintech was a good area.
The first foray was into high-frequency trading. We traded stocks within seconds
and were market makers for all US equities. The technical challenges to
continuously improving our software to generate daily revenue was extremely
satisfying. At my time there I was responsible to executing our expansion into
the Canadian markets.</p>
<p><br>
Moving from the stock markets to the bond markets in next startup was a shift.
The bond markets have limited access to open markets and pricing. We hoped to
change that. It was difficult to convert legacy trading behavior.</p>
<p><br>
After my years in financial and telecom, the healthcare domain beckoned. At
<em>Betterpath</em> we hope to transform patient access to their medical data.</p>
<p><br>
I had a brief stint at a company aiming to help sales by building connection networks.
At <em>Emissay</em> the goal was to it to the product of choice for sales professsionals.</p>
<p><br>
I have been a programming  on backend systems (<em>UNIX</em>) all my career. I am able
to take my technical expertise into new domains and with new teams.  I believe
to build great technology one needs great teams and culture. My passion is to
take business ideas and make them a reality using on my software skills.</p>
